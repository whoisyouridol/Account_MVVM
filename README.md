# Account_MVVM
This is my second "Account" repository, now I tried to write code using MVVM pattern and I added some new features in project.
In this app, user can register in "system", save his login and password, and then sign in "account", in which he can edit some data(Like his city, gender, salary and age) and save it in DB. In folder with name Demo-videos You can see this app-s "real using".
